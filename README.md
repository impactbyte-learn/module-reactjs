- [Adityo Pratomo](https://github.com/lunchboxav)

## Knowledge Gain

- React & React Native
- ES6/ES+
- Node.js & npm
- Asynchronous programming
- Routing
- State management
- JavaScript bundler like Webpack

## Recommended Requirements

- Basic programming
- Basic knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP)
- Basic knowledge of clean code and application architecture such as Model-View-Controller (MVC) or others
- Experience with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6/ES+), Node.js, npm
  - ES6/ES+: arrow function, classes, enhanced object literals, template strings, destructuring, `default` + `rest` + `spread`, `let` + `const`, `iterators` + `for..of`, modules, module loaders, promise, `async` `await`
- laptop (i5/i7, RAM 8GB, 100GB), mobile device

## Typical Agenda

- Introduction
- Yesterday quick review
- Discussion about the topics
- Individual hands on projects, pair programming, and team work
- Team members should contibute each others in a repository

## Notes

All the materials by level are very comprehensive, therefore, it's okay to readjust the materials according to progress and feedbacks from the learners along the way.

It's possible to shift React Native materials earlier if it's convenient. That also cuts out some of the web-related materials that doesn't directly tied into React Native.
